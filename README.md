## Using the action

Validating the well-formedness of a single XML file:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: "XMLLint validate"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - name: Validate XML file
        uses: phpcsstandards/xmllint-validate@v1
        with:
          pattern: "path/to/file.xml"
```

Glob patterns are also supported:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: "XMLLint validate"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - name: Validate XML files
        uses: phpcsstandards/xmllint-validate@v1
        with:
          pattern: "path/to/*/docs/*.xml"
```

Validating XML files against a locally available XSD schema:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: "XMLLint validate"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - name: Validate XML file
        uses: phpcsstandards/xmllint-validate@v1
        with:
          pattern: "path/to/*/docs/*.xml"
          xsd-file: "path/to/docs.xsd"
```

Validating XML files against a remote XSD schema:
```yaml
jobs:
  test:
    name: "XMLLint validate"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v5

      - name: Validate XML file
        uses: phpcsstandards/xmllint-validate@v1
        with:
          pattern: "path/to/*/docs/*.xml"
          xsd-url: "https://examples.org/docs.xsd"
```
